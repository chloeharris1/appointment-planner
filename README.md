# Appointment Planner ðŸ“†

This project is part of Codecademy's Front-End Engineer Path.

## Description  
In this project, I used functional React components, worked with stateful and stateless functional React components using hooks to create an app that manages contacts and appointments. 

The app consists of two pages: one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments.
